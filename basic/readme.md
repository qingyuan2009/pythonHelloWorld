#Python versions
Python has two major versions: 2x and 3x.

Python 2.x was released in 2000. The latest version is 2.7 released in 2010. It isn’t recommended for use in new projects.

Python 3.x was released in 2008. Basically, Python 3 isn’t compatible with Python 2. And you should use the latest versions of Python 3 for your new projects.

#Interpreted
Python is an interpreted language. To develop a Python program, you write Python code into a file called source code. 
To execute the source code, you need to convert it to the machine language that the computer can understand. And the Python interpreter turns the source code, line by line, once at a time, into the machine code when the Python program executes.
Compiled languages like Java and C# use a compiler that compiles the whole source code before the program executes.
